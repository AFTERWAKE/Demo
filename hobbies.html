								Pictured above is my 2015 Yamaha WR250R. I love riding it around
								town and going off road or hitting trails with it. My
								roommate and I in Starkville work on our bikes together and do all the
								work ourselves. It's really a great way to learn about how an
								engine works, and he has taught me so much. I previously owned a
								200cc 2-stroke bike, and we took the engine apart a few times.
								That was definitely a great learning experience, and I look
								forward to learning more about my WR250R's 4-stroke engine.
								Also, since it's a much newer bike, it has a lot of electrical
								components, and it's been pretty fun learning how innovative
								motorcycle companies have gotten with what all they can pack
								under the seat.

								I also like to play some video games on my desktop. When I get
								the chance to play, I usually play Minecraft, Counter-Strike:
								Global Offensive, Grand Theft Auto V, and some short story type
								games too. During the school year I don't get to play too much.
								I didn't really start gaming much until I got to college and
								was surrounded by my computer engineering friends who encouranged
								me to build a PC. I've probably wasted too much time on some games,
								and I've definitely sunk a bit too much money into computer parts,
								but the experiences and the friendships I've built because of
								it are priceless.
