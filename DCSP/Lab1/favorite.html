   <h1>My friend Spongebob</h1>
   <p>SpongeBob SquarePants is a fictional character,
      the protagonist of the American animated television
      series of the same name. He is voiced by actor and
      comedian Tom Kenny, and first appeared on television
      in the series' pilot episode on May 1, 1999.
   </p>

   <p>SpongeBob SquarePants was created and designed by
      cartoonist and marine biologist Stephen Hillenburg
      shortly after the cancellation of Rocko's Modern
      Life in 1996. Hillenburg intended to create a series
      about an over-optimistic sponge that annoys other
      characters. Hillenburg compared the concept to Laurel
      and Hardy and Pee-wee Herman. As he drew the character,
      he decided that a "squeaky-clean square" (like a kitchen
      sponge) fit the concept. His name is derived from
      "Bob the Sponge", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip
      The Intertidal Zone that he originally drew in the 1980s
      while teaching marine biology to visitors of the Ocean
      Institute. SpongeBob is a na√Øve and goofy sea sponge who
      works as a fry cook in the fictional underwater town of
      Bikini Bottom.

   <h1>Special Powers!</h1>
   <p>There are few things that the lovable sponge, Mr. Spongebob, can not do.
      He is trained in the arts of Karate. He can make the best Krabby Patty in
      town. He can draw a perfect circle. He can time travel. He can blow THE
      BEST bubbles. His only drawback is his dire need for water.</p>
